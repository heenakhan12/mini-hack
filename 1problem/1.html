<!-- 1. According to Wikipedia a happy number is defined by the following process :
"Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares
 of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), 
 or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which 
 this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are
 unhappy numbers (or sad numbers)".
Write a JavaScript program to find and print the first 5 happy numbers.
